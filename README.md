Cooking probably doesn't actually need a programming language, so why does this exist? Well, it can become:

- [ ] Structure from natural instructions
- [ ] Clear object references (e.g. `@tomato` = 🍅)
- [ ] Exchangable formatting standards
- [ ] Summarization and detail extraction (e.g. aggregating individual ingredient asks into grocery lists)
- [ ] Cascading substitutions
- [ ] Omissible headmatter, details, and commentary
